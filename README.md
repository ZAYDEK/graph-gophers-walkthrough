# GraphQL Walkthrough

This is a series of tutorials designed to teach you (and me!) GraphQL using the [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) implementation in Go.

<!-- [The first tutorial](https://github.com/ZAYDEK/graph-gophers-walkthrough/blob/master/main-1.go) just confirms whether or not we imported [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) correctly and that it compiles. [In the second to last tutorial](https://github.com/ZAYDEK/graph-gophers-walkthrough/blob/master/main-6.go), we prepare a basic Postgres database with mock data, and interact with it in Go using a GraphQL-powered backend. [And last tutorial](https://github.com/ZAYDEK/graph-gophers-walkthrough/blob/master/main-7.go) demonstrates how to query our GraphQL server, and finally, how to respond to queries over HTTP. -->

<!-- This tutorial series is designed for anyone interested in [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) and assumes a basic understanding of Go and GraphQL. -->
