# GraphQL Walkthrough

I recently learned GraphQL and was blown away at its power and simplicity. As a Gopher, I experimented with several packages before landing on [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) implementation.

This is a series of tutorials designed to teach you (and me!) [graph-gophers/graphlq-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/graphql-go/graphql) from basic to increasingly complex examples.

[The first tutorial](https://github.com/ZAYDEK/graph-gophers-walkthrough/blob/master/main-1.go) just confirms whether or not we imported [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) correctly and that it compiles. [In the second to last tutorial](https://github.com/ZAYDEK/graph-gophers-walkthrough/blob/master/main-6.go), we prepare a basic Postgres database with mock data, and interact with it in Go using a GraphQL-powered backend. [And last tutorial](https://github.com/ZAYDEK/graph-gophers-walkthrough/blob/master/main-7.go) demonstrates how to query a GraphQL service (e.g. a client) and how to respond to queries over HTTP (e.g. a server).

This tutorial series is designed for anyone interested in [graph-gophers/graphql-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) and assumes familiarity with Go and GraphQL; no advanced expertise in either are needed. If you have questions or comments, please feel free to interact with me via Twitter [@username_ZAYDEK](https://twitter.com/username_ZAYDEK) or [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org), @zaydek or in the [#graphql](https://app.slack.com/client/T029RQSE6/C2KQ4U13M) channel.

Thanks!
